# Welcome to Sarah's Github profile!

My name is Sarah and I enjoy changing the world through data and coding! 

I'm originally from Canada and now I live in Utah. 
I love being outdoors - water sports (wakeboarding, paddle boarding, etc.), rock climbing, hiking, snowboarding/skiing, and more!

At home, I have an amazing family and we do everything together! My husband is a chemist and two super cool kids. My little girl is a figure skater, competitive skier and loves watersports and hiking with the family. My little boy who's only 2 at the moment absolutely loves anything with a ball.
